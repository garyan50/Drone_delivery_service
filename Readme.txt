Technology Used
The database was built with MySQL, and the GUI was built using Tkinter in Python.

Work Distribution:
Team built the database together. Junnan wrote most queries of stored procedures and Jiarui wrote most queries of views in MySQL. Zijin and Huansang helped debug the stored procedures and views.
When building GUI, Zijin, Junnan, and Jiarui wrote classes for stores procedures, and Huansang wrote classes for displaying views. Zijin integrated all classes into a runnable program.
